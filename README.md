# Sushi-Themed Website: HTML & CSS Project
Welcome to my project where I've learned to create a modern, fully responsive HTML & CSS website with animations, following the "Creating a Sushi-Themed Website" tutorial by [JavaScript Mastery](https://youtu.be/QRrPE9aj3wI?si=6HF9pfUCu_vUE-xf).

## Description

This repository contains the code and assets for a responsive website inspired by the "Creating a Sushi-Themed Website" tutorial on YouTube by JavaScript Mastery. The tutorial guided me through the process of building a sushi-themed website using HTML and CSS, and it covered various key concepts and techniques, including:

- Using CSS variables
- Importing CSS files into other CSS files
- Utilizing flex and position properties in CSS
- Creating smooth and subtle animations
- Implementing the BEM naming method
- Maintaining a well-organized file and folder structure
- Embracing the principles of writing clean code
